								<h1>Dan Johns</h1>
								<p>My name is Dan Johns and I'm a second-year graduate student in astronomy at Georgia State University under the guidance of Dr. Fabien Baron. I'm interested in interacting binary stars, starspots, and exoplanets. I did my undergrad at Kutztown University, situated 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia. During my undergrad I served in the 109th Field Artillery Batallion and was also a Fire Direction Sergeant in the 28th Infantry Division. My free time is usually spent at the dog park or at home relaxing. I am always listening to music whether it be hardcore, pop punk, or rap; and I enjoy going to shows.</p>

								<h3>Academic Life</h3>
								<p>Hello! I am currently a 2nd year grad student at GSU. I am currently working with Dr. Fabien Baron on ways to improve image reconstruction in optical interferometry and Doppler imaging through dynamical imaging regularzation.</p>
								<p>I grew up in Schuylkill County, PA and received my B.S. in Physics/Astronomy from Kutztown University where I worked with Dr. Phill Reed on Doppler tomography of interacting Algol-type binaries and confirming exoplanet transits for the KELT network. I spent a summer at the University of Southern Queensland for an REU where I worked on revising exoplanet characteristics and commissioning the MINERVA-Australis array.</p>

								<p>My current work focuses on developing an open-source Doppler imaging, interferometric imaging, and light curve inversion-capable code and using dynamical imaging regularizers to recover high fidelity images of stellar surfaces. Traditional imaging campaigns produce snapshots of a star's surface that are not correlated in time. Dynamical imaging utilizes whole datasets to produce a series of frames over many rotations of the star. This provides the advantage of being able to produce movies of a star's surface. The specific dynamical regularizers I am interested in recover a pixel-velocity field on the star's surface that can be used to smoothly evolve the star and interpolate frames. These recovered pixel-velocity fields will hopefully be used to reveal the nature of differential rotation and track spots over time to study stellar dynamos.</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: center">Exoplanets</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/kelt.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<p>Throughout my undergrad I was heavily involved with photometric follow up for the KELT network. I helped lead the discovery of KELT-23Ab, a hot Jupiter on a death spiral into its host star that is close to the TESS and JWST continuous viewing zones. I was fortunate enough to be able to work with the team at the University of Southern Queensland on several projects such as revising exoplanet parameters using newly released Gaia data, photometric commissioning of the MINERVA-Australis array, and decomposing high eccentricity, single planet systems into multi planet, low eccentricity systems. </p>
								<h3 style="text-align: center">Interacting Binaries</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bet_lyr.gif" alt=""/></span>
								<p> In my undergrad I was also very fortunate to work on a very exciting class of binary stars known as interacting Algol-type binaries. These stars show a mass transfer stream that builds a transient, unstable accretion disk. When observed these systems fall into one of two states: a stream-dominated state or a disk-dominated state. Interacting algols can oscillate between these states by an unknown mechanism and at an unknown timescale. Under the guidance of Dr. Phill Reed I used the technique of back projection Doppler tomography to indirectly image the different accretion features present in the system in the hopes of learning about the cycles that modulate the stream's strength and disperse the transient accretion annulus.</p>
